When I get sad, I just stop being sad and read some of these quotes instead. Here are some of the Bad-Ass Quotes that will inspire the hell out of you (starting with my personal favorite):

<blockquote> "The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It is a very mean and nasty place It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me or nobody is going to hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you're hit, it is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much can you take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!" <cite>- Rocky Balboa (2006)</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote> "Investing in yourself is the best investment you will ever make. it will not only improve your life, it will improve the lives of all those around you." <cite>- Robin S. Sharma</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote> "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." <cite>- Mahatma Gandhi</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote> "Your 'I CAN' is more important than your IQ." <cite>- Robin S. Sharma</cite></blockquote>
