There was a monkey, restless by his own nature, as all monkeys are. As if that were not enough someone made him drink freely of wine, so that he became still more restless. Then a scorpion stung him. When a man is stung by a scorpion, he jumps about for a whole day; so the poor monkey found his condition worse than ever. To complete his misery a demon entered into him. What language can describe the uncontrollable restlessness of that monkey? The human mind is like that monkey, incessantly active by its own nature; then it becomes drunk with the wine of **DESIRE**, thus increasing its turbulence. After desire takes possession comes the sting of the scorpion of **JEALOUSY** at the success of others, and last of all the demon of **PRIDE** enters the mind, making it think itself of all importance. How hard to control such a mind!
