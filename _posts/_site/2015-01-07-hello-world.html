<p>Hola amigos!</p>

<p>This is just a cliché <em>hello world!</em> post. To know about me and why I’ve started
this website, please visit the <a href="http://www.rahilarora.com/about/">about
section</a>. I wanted to start my blog with a
technical (security related) post, but I’ve not been able to read anything
interesting, as I’m currently enjoying most of my time with my family in India.
Anyways, I’ll just give a quick introduction to what you can expect from the
website.</p>

<p>This site is an attempt to improve my knowledge and writing skills, by
contributing something useful, back to the security community. It will also act
as a useful resource for the beginners who are interested in topics such as
Cryptography, Application Security and Network Security. I will try to explain
things/concepts in simple terms in order to target different types of readers at
different levels of understanding. However, I beleive that the posts and the
<a href="http://www.rahilarora.com/useful_resources/">resources</a> I’ll be sharing, will
be of great use to current graduate/undergrad students, who are willing to
pursue a career in Security.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@rahilarora.com">email me</a>, if you want me to share
something specific or need any advice/help. Please feel free to do the same or
leave a comment below, if you have any advice for me or any comment regarding
anything on this website. <em>We are all here to learn. That’s what life is all
about!</em></p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>Stay tuned…</p>
