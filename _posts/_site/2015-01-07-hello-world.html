<p>Hola amigos!</p>

<p>This is just a cliché <em>hello world!</em> post. To know about me and why I’ve started this website, please visit the [About section]. I wanted to start my blog with a technical (security related) post, but I’ve not been able to read anything interesting, as am currently enjoying most of my time with my family in India. Anyways, I’ll just give a quick introduction to what you can expect from the website.</p>

<p>This site is an attempt to improve my knowledge and writing skills by contributing something useful back to the security community. It will also act as a useful resource for the beginners who are interested in the topics such as Cryptography, Application Security and Network Security. I will try to explain things/concepts in simple terms in order to target different types of readers at different levels of understanding. However, I beleive that the posts and the <a href="http://www.rahilarora.com/useful_resources/">resources</a> I’ll be sharing, will be of great use to current graduate/undergrad students, who are willing to pursue a career in Security. I’ll also be sharing my experiences from my grad school and various job interviews that I attended.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#099;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#097;&#099;&#116;&#064;&#114;&#097;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#097;&#114;&#111;&#114;&#097;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">email me</a>, if you want me to share something specific or need any advice/help. Please feel free to do the same or leave a comment below, if you have any advice for me or any comment on anything on this website. <em>We are all here to learn. That’s what life is all about!</em></p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>Stay tuned…</p>
