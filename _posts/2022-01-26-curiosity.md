Curiosity is a superpower. Through curiosity, it is possible to understand and learn anything in the world. Curiosity is what helps us dig deeper and ask questions.

But what if I'm not naturally curious? Self reflection helps identify any gaps in our knowledge. Gaps in our knowledge lead to curiosity. Curiosity is fueled once we know enough to know that we do not know. Curiosity is habit forming once we start treating any question we ask as a path to a better question.

`"If we want to make the world add up, we need to ask open minded, genuine questions."` <cite>- Tim Harford</cite>
