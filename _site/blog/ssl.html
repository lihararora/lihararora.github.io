	<title>A Sad Story of SSL – Rahil Arora</title>
	<meta name="description" content="

Back when I was pursuing my Master’s, I gave a small presentation on how SSL/TLS protocol has been affected by various protocol specific attacks, how these issues have been patched, and, most importantly, what could have prevented SSL/TLS from these attacks. I tried explaining these issues in the form a “story”. Since I’ve not been able to write anything new, I thought it’d be a good idea to share this presentation here.

This paper talks about some SSL/TLS implementation specific issues, which the authors found by analysing some critical libraries and applications. Here is the presentation:
