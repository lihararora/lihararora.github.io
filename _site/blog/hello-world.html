	<meta name="description" content="

Hola amigos!

This is just a cliché hello world! post. To know about me and why I’ve started
this website, please visit the about
section. I wanted to start my blog with a
technical (security related) post, but I’ve not been able to read anything
interesting, as I’m currently enjoying most of my time with my family in India.
Anyways, I’ll just give a quick introduction to what you can expect from the
website.

This site is an attempt to improve my knowledge and writing skills, by
contributing something useful, back to the security community. It will also act
as a useful resource for the beginners who are interested in topics such as
Cryptography, Application Security and Network Security. I will try to explain
things/concepts in simple terms in order to target different types of readers at
different levels of understanding. However, I beleive that the posts and the
resources I’ll be sharing, will
be of great use to current graduate/undergrad students, who are willing to
pursue a career in Security.

Feel free to email me, if you want me to share
something specific or need any advice/help. Please feel free to do the same or
leave a comment below, if you have any advice for me or any comment regarding
anything on this website. We are all here to learn. That’s what life is all
about!

Thank you for reading!

Stay tuned…
