Hey there! Welcome to my personal website! :-)  

My name is Rahil Arora. I am a Security Engineer at [iSEC Partners](https://www.isecpartners.com/), living and working in San Francisco Bay Area. I graduated from the [Johns Hopkins Universty - Information Security Institute](http://isi.jhu.edu) with a Master's in Security Informatics. My primary areas of interest include Cryptography, Web Application Security and Network Security. [Email me](mailto:contact@rahilarora.com) to get more professional inforamtion (or to request my CV).

### Hobbies

I love playing tennis! I also like to learn new languages (Spanish being my personal favorite - "Me encanta Espa√±ol!") and sometimes, I use phrases from different languages to impress (and annoy) my dearest friends. When I don't feel like doing anything, I simply enjoy some [good bollywood music](http://8tracks.com/lihararora/my-comfort-zone) with a cup of [Masala Tea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_chai).

### This Site

*Built on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), based on [Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/), powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).*

This site is inspired by [Daniel Miessler's awesome website](https://danielmiessler.com/) and is being used as a techinical blog on security related topics (views are my own). As a graduate student, I learned so many cool things from some very cool technical blogs out there. Now I feel that it's time for me to make some contirbution to the security community as well. I'll try to learn something new, once in a while, and will share it through this blog. I'll also be using this site to share some very [useful resources](http://www.rahilarora.com/useful_resources), which can be used to explore different areas of Computer Security.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to either comment below or [email me](mailto:contact@rahilarora.com) or contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lihararora).

Thanks for reading!
